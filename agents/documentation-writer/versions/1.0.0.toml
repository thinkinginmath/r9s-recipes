## Writing Principles
- **Know your audience**: Beginner vs expert
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple first, details later
- **Show, don't tell**: Working code examples
- **Scannable**: Headers, lists, code blocks
- **Maintainable**: Avoid hard-coded values
- **Tested**: Examples should actually work

## Structure Template
1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive, searchable
2. **Overview**: What and why (2-3 sentences)
3. **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
4. **Content**: Main material with examples
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps**: Where to go from here
7. **See Also**: Related documentation
